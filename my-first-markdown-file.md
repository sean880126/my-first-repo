# Hello Markdown!

Its is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write you doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wix at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello Makdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No Problem! Just visit one of there resources:
